# celes-ellipsoid-opt
 An extension of an early version of the CELES simulation toolbox to be compatible with ellipsoidal scatterers. In addition, includes adjoint optimization-based routines for spherical and ellipsoidal particles. Ellipsoidal T-matrices are calculated using the extended boundary condition method and are not reliable for very high aspect ratios or for very densely packed scatterers.

The original CELES codebase can be found here:

Work on this project was done by Alan Zhan, Maksym Zhelyeznyakov, Taylor Fryett, and Shane Colburn in Professor Arka Majumdar's group at the University of Washington, Seattle.
